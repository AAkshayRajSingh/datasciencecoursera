R Markdown and Leaflet Assignment
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
```{r}
require(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()




for (b in -30:30)
{
    for (a in 30:(-30))
    {
        
        if (((a*0.05)^2+(b*0.1)^2-1)^3-(a*0.05)^2*(b*0.1)^3 <= 0 ) 
        my_map <- addMarkers(my_map, lat=38.3451691+b/10000,lng=-0.48149+a/10000, popup="Hi there. ;-) - 21 Aug 2020")
    }
}
        
my_map
```
